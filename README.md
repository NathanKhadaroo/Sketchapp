# Sketchapp

Sketchapp is a desktop application built with Electron to help artists track their daily art progress. Each day, the app presents a new drawing prompt, allows users to upload their artwork, and maintains a gallery of past submissions. This tool is designed to help artists maintain a consistent practice schedule, improve over time, and easily revisit their previous works.

## Features

- **Upload Artwork:** Easily upload your drawings and paintings.
